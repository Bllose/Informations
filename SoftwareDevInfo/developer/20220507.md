### April Headline: MATLAB about to drop out of top 20    
Good old MATLAB is about to drop out of the top 20 for the first time in more than 10 years. 
The MATLAB programming language is mainly used in the numerical analysis domain. 
It is often combined with Simulink models, which are from the same MathWorks company. 
Although MATLAB has a biannual release cycle, the language doesn't evolve that much. 
And since MATLAB licenses are rather expensive, alternatives are catching up quickly now. 
Its main competitors are Python (currently number 1) and Julia (moving from position 32 to position 26 this month).   
--Paul Jansen CEO TIOBE Software
