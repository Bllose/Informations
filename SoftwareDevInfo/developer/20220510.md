## What's the Best Programming Language to Learn in 2022?  
-- Nick Schaferhoff  
Are you **wondering** what's the best programming language to learn in 2022?
Which first or additional technology can you pick up that will help you get a well-paying job?  

It's not as simple of a choice as it seems.
Some language are popular and **oversaturated**, while others are **trendy** but **obscure** among **recruiters**.
Either way it can be hard to find a job with them.
Other coding languages are very old and it can be hard to break into an industry with developers who **possess** 20+ years of experience.
Some are high in **demand** and low in supply, but very difficult to learn and **apply**.
