# What is it  
A **zero-day** is a computer-software vulnerability either unknown to those who should be interested in its mitigation (including the vendor of the target software) or
known and without a patch to correct it.  -- Wiki    
**mitigation** noun \[U\] the act of reducing how harmful, unpleasant, or bad something is.  
- There has been no significant increase in funding for flood mitigation works.  

**patch** noun \[C\] COMPUTER  
a small computer program that can be added to an existing program in order to make the existing program work as it should.  

**vendor** noun \[C\] someone who is selling something.  
- For the past few months she's been working as a street vendor, selling fruit and vegetables.

The term "zero-day" originally referred to the number of days since a new piece of software was released to the public, so "zero-day software" was obtained by hacking into a developer's computer before release. Eventually the term was applied to the vulnerabilities that allowed this hacking, and to the number of days that the vendor has had to fix them. Once the vendors learn of the vulnerability, they will usually create patches or advise workarounds to mitigate it.  
> **obtain** verb GET  
> (B2) to get something, especially by asking for it, buying it, working for it, or producing it from something else.

The more recently that the vendor has become aware of the vulnerability, the more likely it is that no fix or mitigation has been developed. Once a fix is developed, the chance of the exploit succeeding decreases as more users apply the fix over time. For zero-day exploits, unless the vulnerability is inadvertently fixed, such as by an unrelated update that happens to fix the vulnerability, the probability that a user has applied a vendor-supplied patch that fixes the problem is zero, so the exploit would remain available. Zero-day attacks are a severe threat.[5]
